# Simple Mandelbrot Program for Gameboy Advance

## Written in c by loonafox

This is a simple mandelbrot set code written in c which can be compiled to run on the gameboy advance

The makefile is based on [this](https://gist.github.com/JShorthouse/bfe49cdfad126e9163d9cb30fd3bf3c2) and the perl script is listed here too. The c program I wrote myself using [this](https://ianfinlayson.net/class/cpsc305/samples/gba/hello.c) as a resource. (I also copied two of the functions as it would be almost exactly the same way i would implement them myself(color and put\_pixel))
